# nuxt3-socketio-monorepo-test

This is a basic test repository for a nuxt3 socketio monorepo.

## Build Setup

```bash
# install dependencies
$ pnpm i

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ pnpm run dev

# build for production and launch server
$ pnpm run build

```

I wrote this app to test the monorepo typescript function together with nuxt3 and socketio. With Hono as a backend and nuxt3 as the frontend.
